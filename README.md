# The-Tech-Academy-Projects

This Repository is utilized for my projects created while attending the "The Tech Academy". I aim to use my current experience as a Operational Anaylyst in Real Estate/Private Equity to pivot and work in a more technical and data driven role.

Thank you in advance for visiting my Github!

# I am maintaining this repo to keep all history for practice assignments for proof of completion for bootcamp | Will be removed after Bootcamp completion
